    "# Prompt Template Prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompt Template Prompting refers to a technique where predefined templates are used to construct effective prompts that guide large language models (LLMs) to generate responses tailored to specific use cases. The templates typically contain static text combined with dynamic input variables, allowing for consistent, reusable, and customizable prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompt templates are widely used across various domains, such as:\n",
    "* **Question Generation**: Templates can generate quiz questions by filling in variables related to topics.\n",
    "* **Text Summarization**: Static instructions combined with variable documents or inputs allow flexible summarization.\n",
    "* **Coding Assistance**: Dynamic prompts help LLMs generate code snippets for different programming tasks.\n",

      "**Understanding SQL Indexes**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Concept Explanation:**\n",
      "A SQL index is a data structure that improves the speed of query execution by allowing the database to quickly locate specific data. Think of it like a phonebook for your database - when you want to find a specific name, you can look it up in the phonebook much faster than searching through all the names.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Toy Analogy:**\n",
      "Imagine you have a huge library with millions of books. You're looking for a specific book on a particular topic. Instead of searching through every single book, you use an index that lists all the topics and their corresponding page numbers. This way, you can quickly find the book you need without having to search through the entire library.\n",
      "\n",
      "**SQL Code Snippet:**\n",
      "```sql\n",
      "CREATE TABLE books (\n",
      "    id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
      "    title VARCHAR(255),\n",
      "    author VARCHAR(255)\n",
      ");\n",
      "\n",
      "CREATE INDEX idx_title ON books (title);\n",
      "\n",
      "SELECT * FROM books WHERE title = 'Python Programming';\n",
      "```\n",
      "In this example, we create a table `books` with columns for the book's ID, title, and author. We then create an index on the `title` column using the `CREATE INDEX` statement. Finally, we use the `SELECT` statement to find all books with a title that matches 'Python Programming'. The index speeds up the query by allowing the database to quickly locate the relevant data.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Practice Question:**\n",
      "Write a SQL query to create an index on the `name` column of the `employees` table, assuming the following table structure:\n",
      "```sql\n",
      "CREATE TABLE employees (\n",
      "    id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
      "    name VARCHAR(255),\n",
      "    department VARCHAR(255)\n",
      ");\n",
      "```\n",
      "What would be the syntax for creating an index on this column?\n",
      "\n",
      "**Answer:** `CREATE INDEX idx_name ON employees (name);`\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a simple exercise to reinforce your understanding of SQL indexes. Remember, indexes can significantly improve query performance, especially when dealing with large datasets!\n",

      "**Lesson 1: Introduction to SQL**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Concept Explanation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language designed for managing and manipulating data in relational databases. Think of it like a set of instructions that helps you organize and retrieve information from a vast collection of data, similar to how you would follow a recipe to make your favorite dish.\n",
      "\n",
      "Imagine you have a big library with millions of books. SQL allows you to ask questions about the books, such as \"What's the title of every book written by John Grisham?\" or \"Which book is the most popular among all authors?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "**Real-World Example:**\n",
      "\n",
      "You're a data analyst working for an e-commerce company. You need to analyze customer purchase history to identify trends and make informed decisions about product recommendations. SQL helps you extract relevant data from your database, making it easier to answer questions like:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Which products are most frequently purchased together?\n",
      "* What's the average order value for customers in a specific region?\n",
      "\n",
      "**Practical Exercise:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Create a simple table with customer information, including name, email, and purchase history.\n",
      "\n",
      "```sql\n",
      "CREATE TABLE customers (\n",
      "    id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
      "    name VARCHAR(255),\n",
      "    email VARCHAR(255)\n",
      ");\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "Insert some sample data:\n",
      "\n",
      "```sql\n",
      "INSERT INTO customers (id, name, email)\n",
      "VALUES\n",
      "(1, 'John Doe', 'john.doe@example.com'),\n",
      "(2, 'Jane Smith', 'jane.smith@example.com');\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let's try to answer a question using SQL. What if you wanted to find all customers who have made at least one purchase?\n",
      "\n",
      "```sql\n",
      "SELECT *\n",
      "FROM customers\n",
      "WHERE id IN (\n",
      "    SELECT customer_id\n",
      "    FROM orders\n",
      ");\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "This code selects all columns (`*`) from the `customers` table where the `id` matches a value in the `customer_id` column of the `orders` table. Run this query to see the results!\n",
