    "# Self Consistency Prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the more advanced techniques in prompt engineering is self-consistency, introduced by `Wang et al. (2022)`. \n",
    "\n",
    "This method seeks to improve upon the traditional greedy decoding typically used in chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. \n",
    "\n",
    "The core concept involves sampling multiple diverse reasoning paths through few-shot CoT and leveraging these variations to determine the most consistent answer. The technique  enhances the effectiveness of CoT prompting, particularly for tasks requiring arithmetic and commonsense reasoning.\n",

      "\n",
      "Debugging is the process of identifying and fixing errors in computer code.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Why is debugging important?**\n",
      "    *   Debugging ensures that software or code functions correctly and efficiently.\n",
      "    *   It helps prevent bugs from causing system crashes, data loss, or security breaches.\n",
      "\n",
      "### How to Start Debugging\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Use a Debugger**: A debugger is a tool that helps you identify and fix errors in your code.\n",
      "2.  **Run Your Code**: Run your code as it normally would, but with the debugger enabled.\n",
      "3.  **Analyze the Error Message**: Study the error message provided by the debugger to understand what's going wrong.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Code Snippet: Basic Debugger Example**\n",
      "```python\n",
      "import pdb\n",
      "\n",
      "def add(a, b):\n",
      "    pdb.set_trace()  # This will stop execution at this point\n",
      "    return a + b\n",
      "\n",
      "result = add(2, 3)\n",
      "print(result)  # Output: 5\n",
      "```\n",
      "3.  **Check Your Variables**: Make sure your variables are in the correct scope and have the expected values.\n",
      "4.  **Test Small Changes**: Gradually make small changes to your code to see if that resolves the issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Example Use Case:** Debugging a Simple Calculator Program\n",
      "\n",
      "Suppose we want to create a simple calculator program that takes two numbers as input and returns their sum. However, when we run the program, it keeps returning an incorrect result. We can use the debugging techniques outlined above to identify the source of the problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a sample code for the calculator program:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "def add(a, b):\n",
      "    return a + b\n",
      "\n",
      "result = add(2, 3)\n",
      "print(result)  # Output: ???\n",
      "```\n",
      "To debug this program, we can start by running it with different inputs to see if we can identify any patterns. We notice that the result is incorrect when both inputs are large numbers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, we can use a debugger or print statements to inspect the variables and values involved in the calculation. For example:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "def add(a, b):\n",
      "    return a + b\n",
      "\n",
      "a = 2\n",
      "b = 3\n",
      "print(\"a =\", a)\n",
      "print(\"b =\", b)\n",
      "result = add(a, b)\n",
      "print(\"Result:\", result)\n",
      "```\n",
      "This reveals that the issue is with the addition operation itself. We can then try to debug the `add` function individually.\n",
      "\n",
      "After debugging the `+` operator, we find that it's working correctly. The problem lies in the way the inputs are being passed to the function. We realize that the inputs are not integers but rather floating-point numbers due to a previous operation in the code.\n",
      "\n",
      "To fix this issue, we need to cast the inputs back to integers before adding them together. Here's how we can do it:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "def add(x, y):\n",
      "    return x + y\n",
      "\n",
      "# Example usage:\n",
      "x = 3.5  # floating-point number\n",
      "y = 2.7  # floating-point number\n",
      "result = int(add(x, y))  # cast result back to integer\n",
      "print(result)  # prints: 6\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "Now we have a function that correctly adds two numbers together and returns the result as an integer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Note: If you want to allow for decimal points in your input numbers, you might need a more sophisticated solution.\n",
