A Discord-based study companion chatbot that simplifies complex concepts, making advanced topics easier for students to understand.

1-liner description of your project

This study investigates advanced prompting techniques to improve requirement analysis for a Discord-based educational chatbot powered by the llama3.2 model. The objective is to assess various prompting strategies and enhance the chatbot’s effectiveness in supporting student learning. Developing an AI-powered chatbot integrated into Discord to assist students in understanding advanced SQL and Python concepts by breaking them down into simpler, more digestible explanations. We analyze how different prompting strategies impact requirement structuring and explore optimizations to enhance AI-driven requirement analysis.

# Research Question 

  How can an AI-driven chatbot within Discord enhance students' comprehension of complex SQL and Python concepts by simplifying explanations and providing interactive learning support using llama 3.2.

## Arguments

#### What is already known about this topic

•	Large Language Models (LLMs) such as Llama 3.2 and Phi-4 can produce structured requirement analysis reports.
•	Different prompt engineering methods (e.g., zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought) affect the precision and depth of insights for chatbot development.
•	AI-powered study companions have proven beneficial in education by making complex concepts easier to understand.
•	Optimizing prompts can enhance the chatbot’s ability to adapt to diverse student learning needs and preferences.


#### What this research is exploring

This research investigates the application of natural language processing (NLP) and large language models (LLMs) to enhance the chatbot's comprehension of student inquiries. The chatbot is engineered to offer real-time elucidations, code examples, debugging support, and quiz-oriented education for SQL and Python. Furthermore the chatbot aims to utilize adaptive learning techniques to customize solutions based on student progress and knowledge gaps.

#### Implications for practice

This chatbot is designed to facilitate prompt support for students with SQL and Python inquiries. By offering organized, interactive, and captivating explanations, it enhances the learning experience. This project will enhance the understanding of how AI chatbots can facilitate programming education and augment student outcomes.

# Research Method

The study adheres to a systematic development methodology. The chatbot is initially developed and executed via an AI model particularly trained for SQL and Python problem-solving. Upon integration into Discord, it enters a pilot testing phase, during which it is implemented among students to gather feedback on its effectiveness, engagement, and usability.
The evaluation stage consists on observing user interactions, evaluating their learning progress, and using performance criteria and questionnaires to gauge students satisfaction. These results lead the chatbot to be improved by adding more features such as automatic evaluations and code execution powers. The chatbot's features will help students further more effectively as it evolves.


# Results


| Technique           | Accuracy   | Completeness  | Consistency  | Efficiency  |
|---------------------|-----------|--------------|-------------|------------|
| Zero-Shot         | Medium    | Low          | High        | High       |
| Few-Shot         | High      | Medium       | Medium      | Medium     |
| Chain-of-Thought  | High      | High         | Medium      | Low        |
| Meta-Prompting   | High      | High         | High        | Medium     |
| Self-Consistency | Very High | Very High    | High        | Low        |

This research main aim is to show how well an AI-powered chatbot on Discord can simplify difficult SQL and Python subjects thereby improving student knowledge and involvement. The expected outcomes are positive student assessments, better problem-solving skills, and increased memory of programming concepts.

# Further research

Future research directions encompass enhancing the chatbot's adaptability to different learning styles through reinforcement learning, linking it with the online coding platforms for real-time practice, and by extending its capabilities to include more programming languages and computer science subjects. Moreover, using longitudinal research will help to evaluate how chatbot-based learning affects student performance going forward. This work aims to advance the development of AI-powered learning tools enhancing programming education and helping students effectively learn SQL and Python.
